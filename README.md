# My project topic is *ONLINE PARCEL SYSTEM*

To define project in brief, lets take up with an example:-
Suppose we are at our friend's/relatives place and unknowingly we forgot something at their place and we have to get it back without personally going there. So, this project comes up with solution for this problem about how are we going to get back the things without going there.

For parcel system, we have to enter each and every detail of sender as well as receiver. 
For example:- For sender we need to know the Name, Address, Pincode etc. And same goes with the Receiver.
In my project, i have come up with solution like, I have given 3 options to chose valid ID proof. These are:-
1.Aadhar Card
2.Voter ID
3.Driving license
When user will select any one from the above options, he'll only have to  upload the ID number and likewise all his  details will be shown automatically.
Then the user have to enter his order pickup and delivery details for fast and safe delivery.

 For this, First :
-we need to declare headers file
-Then, create class
-Then, create main method and define variable.
After that, we have to create an object for parcel, the list for parcel object and the list for customer object also.
Then we add the customer object in the list.
After that, we create a scanner object to take as much input we want.
For taking information regarding sender and receiver through user, we use switch case.
We will we giving a code to generate  random order ID.
Then, we save order object into file. Using switch case we view the order and whether to cancel a order using switch case we have given a code. Saving the object into file.
Then, 
create a class for customer object > create public constructor. 
Then, create various getters and setters.
Then, create class for parcel object and use serialization to convert this object into file stream and again creating various getters and setters.
